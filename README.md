# Regex Tutorial Starter Code

Starter Code provided by Xandromus

AS A web development student<br>
I WANT a tutorial explaining a specific regex<br>
SO THAT I can understand the search pattern the regex defines<br>
GIVEN a regex tutorial<br>
WHEN I open the tutorial<br>
THEN I see a descriptive title and introductory paragraph explaining the purpose of the tutorial, a summary describing the regex featured in the tutorial, a table of contents linking to different sections that break down each component of the regex and explain what it does, and a section about the author with a link to the author’s GitHub profile<br
WHEN I click on the links in the table of contents<br
THEN I am taken to the corresponding sections of the tutorial<br
WHEN I read through each section of the tutorial<br
THEN I find a detailed explanation of what a specific component of the regex does<br>
WHEN I reach the end of the tutorial<br>
THEN I find a section about the author and a link to the author’s GitHub profile<br>
